names for files are given as follows:
test + player1 + player2 + enhancement(0/1) + selection type (1/2) (for max child and robust child)

so the name: test3.0.0.1 
means that is it the test for the MCTS(3) player vs random(0) player without enhancement(0) with the max child selection(1) as selection type for the MCTS algorithm.
